# Cursor Collaboration Rules

- The AI assistant will only provide terminal commands and will never execute them.
- Commands will be provided as single-shot, copy-paste ready lines suitable for Windows PowerShell.
- No long-running background jobs unless explicitly requested.
- Any destructive actions (e.g., rm -rf, Remove-Item -Recurse -Force) will be explicitly called out.
